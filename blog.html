    <p>Github is the largest online code-sharing service. It allows programmers to collaborate together on projects, receive feedback from their users, and control versions of their code. It's also a place where developers can make their code available to the public (open-source) as a reference for others. Currently, Github reports having 27 million users and 77 million repositories (projects). Even organizations use this service, including <a href="https://github.com/nasa">NASA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nationalsecurityagency"> the NSA</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apple">Apple</a> use Github. </p>
    <p>I personally use Github almost daily for robotics and recently used it to work together with my team during a hackathon. It makes coding in general much easier and also allows members of the team to share and work together. Also, this year, software for the robotics libraries are all hosted on Github, opposed to last year when all the information was in multiple PDFs. The clean interface and design of the Github documents are also much nicer and make it easier to read through. </p>
    <p>Furthermore, I've seen hackathon projects that were made possible using Github's service. Github makes it possible for the members of the team to work together on their hack. Hackathons benefit society because of how students are solving real-world problems using technology. Additionally, there are often awards given to hacks for social good and the winning hack for that category is always insightful. </p>
    <p> Overall, without Github, organizing code projects would be much more tedious, which is why it's currently my favourite piece of technology. In fact, this website is hosted on Github Pages, which is a free hosting website that Github provides. It links directly to the Github repository as well, meaning no external hosting service is required. </p>
