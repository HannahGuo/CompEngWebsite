      <br><br>
      <span class="center"><b>Reasoning</b></span>
      <b>CPU</b>
      <p>With five thousand dollars to spend, I wanted to have a computer with the fastest performance. For my CPU, I chose the Intel - Core i7-8700K 3.7GHz 6-Core processor. Previously, I knew that the i7 Intel processors were the fastest (after the extremely
        expensive i9 processors, which I didn’t think I needed, and were double the price of the i7 processors). From there, I chose the fastest i7 processor. This CPU has 6 cores, 12 threads and runs at 3.7GHz base frequency speed.</p>

      <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpus,3986.html">Additional Reference</a><br><br>

      <b>CPU Cooler</b>
      <p>When looking at coolers, I didn’t need the most powerful cooler because I would never be overclocking the CPU. In the end, I chose the Corsair - H100i v2 70.7 CFM Liquid CPU cooler because it was an affordable and effective cooler with positive
        ratings.</p>

      <b>Motherboard</b>
      <p>The Gigabyte - Z370 AORUS Gaming 5 (rev. 1.0) ATX LGA1151 motherboard is a top of the line motherboard. Although it’s expensive for a motherboard and is meant for gaming, I can afford it with this budget and it’s worth investing in for the performance
        it provides. This motherboard has a built-in Wifi and Bluetooth adapter, as well as a sound card, so I wouldn’t need to purchase these additional adapters. Other factors that made me choose this motherboard include the fact that it is durable
        and has addressable RGB LEDs.</p>

      <b>Memory</b>
      <p>I chose to invest in 32GB of RAM because I never want to have any problems with running out of RAM. The G.Skill - Trident Z RGB 32GB (4 x 8GB) DDR4-3000 Memory operates at 3000 clock cycles with Double Data Rate (DDR), meaning it will be fast enough
        for anything I use the computer for. The RAM also has full RGB support as an extra perk.</p>

      <b>Storage</b>
      <p>For storage, I chose to install two SAMSUNG 960 PRO M.2 512GB NVMe PCI-Express 3.0 x4 Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) MZ-V6P512BW. SSDs are faster compared to HDDs (hard disk drives) because SSDs store information on microchips and simply send
        a command to fetch information, whereas HDDs need to move a physical head to read and write data. I wanted 1TB of storage space because I believe that will be enough for school work and games. I can always use cloud storage if my SSDs run out
        of storage.</p>

      <p>I will also put my SSDs in RAID 0 to improve performance. RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) 0, also called disk striping, means that data will be spread across the two disks in the group. This makes accessing the data much faster.</p>

      <a href="http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/RAID-0-disk-striping">Additional Reference</a><br><br>

      <b>Video Card</b>
      <p>I chose the MSI - GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11GB GAMING X for my video card. Considering I’m spending $5000 on this PC, I wanted to have an amazing video card. This video card provides a superior performance and a fast, smooth experience. If I ever decide
        to play VR, this video card is also able to handle that. As another perk, this video card has addressable RGB LEDs, which goes along with the rest of the PC.</p>

      <b>Case</b>
      <p>The case for my computer is a NZXT - S340 Elite (Black/Red) ATX Mid Tower. Overall, it’s a cleanly designed case that is strong and compact. The colours of the case, black and red, are simply a personal preference.</p>

      <b>Power Supply</b>
      <p>The EVGA - SuperNOVA P2 650W 80+ Platinum Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply provides more than enough power for my PC, which requires 489W. This power supply is 80+ Platinum, meaning that it is rated for at least 89% at 100% load, which is
        the best rating for a power supply. To contrast, the basic 80+ rating means the power supply is rated for at least 50% at 100% load.</p>

      <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/how-does-psu-efficiency-affect-me-and-do-i-really-need-an-80-plus-gold-power-supply.129456">Additional Reference</a><br><br>

      <b>Case Fans</b>
      <p>Considering how much power my PC uses, I decided to invest in two case fans to keep it from overheating. The two Corsair - LL120 RGB LED 43.2 CFM 120mm fans will accomplish this perfectly, and even have 16 independent RGB LEDs that go along with
        the rest of the PC.</p>

      <b>Monitor</b>
      <p>I chose the Dell - S2417DG 23.8" 2560x1440 165Hz monitor because of the monitor’s fast refresh rate, high resolution and large size. This monitor will be perfect for anything I need to use the computer for.</p>

      <b>Keyboard</b>
      <p>The Logitech - G213 PRODIGY Wired Gaming Keyboard is a solid keyboard that can be used for both gaming and work. The design is clean and looks good, especially with its RGB lighting.</p>

      <b>Mouse</b>
      <p>The Logitech - G502 Proteus Spectrum Wired Optical Mouse is an ergonomic gaming mouse that comes with 11 programmable buttons, rubber grip, and a 1ms report rate. These features will not only be useful for when I’m gaming but also make working much
        smoother. Furthermore, this mouse has programmable RGB lights.</p>

      <b>Headphones</b>
      <p>With the remainder of my $5000 budget, I decided to buy a pair of Logitech headphones. The Logitech - G430 7.1 Channel Headset is noise-canceling and comes with a microphone. Both these features make using this PC for gaming or work calls very easy.</p>

      <b>Additional Notes</b>
      <p>Due to the high price of the full Windows 10 OS, I will be using Linux or Windows 10 evaluation, both of which are free. Any necessary Microsoft Office software can be downloaded for free through Education or a free alternative can be used.</p>

      <b>Overall</b>
      <p>Overall, this PC build was optimized to have the highest performance for the given budget. I will use this primarily for school work, programming and gaming, meaning all the parts will work perfectly. This computer is also built to last a very long time, since it was so expensive to build. Due to my high budget, I also decided to use parts that had RGB capabilities, just for the looks.</p>

      <span style="font-size: 8px">Thanks to the two grade twelves who guided me through building this PC, where everything is <i>the pinnacle of PC performance</i>.</span>

      <img src="images/inspectocat.jpg" id="octo" />
      <p>Github is the largest online code-sharing service. It allows programmers to collaborate together on projects, receive feedback from their users, and control versions of their code. It's also a place where developers can make their code available
        to the public (open-source) as a reference for others. Currently, Github reports having 27 million users and 77 million repositories (projects). Even organizations use this service, including <a href="https://github.com/nasa">NASA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nationalsecurityagency"> the NSA</a>        and <a href="https://github.com/apple">Apple</a> use Github. </p>
      <p>I personally use Github almost daily for robotics to work together with my programming team. It makes coding in general much easier and also allows members of the team to share and work together. Also, this year, software for the robotics libraries
        are all hosted on Github, opposed to last year when all the information was in multiple PDFs. The clean interface and design of the Github documents are also much nicer and make it easier to read through. </p>
      <p>Github also has many other features for student developers, which gives them the tools they need to properly build their program. In fact, this website is hosted on Github Pages, which is a free hosting website that Github provides. It links directly
        to the Github repository as well, meaning no external hosting service is required.</p>
      <p>As our society becomes more technologically-driven, more and more programmers are creating software for our everyday lives. Github allows these great minds to work together to code the programs for our future. This can already be demonstrated during
        hackathons, where programmers work together to create a hack for a real-world problem. I've seen hacks created to help those with disabilities, to monitor nutrition and to educate younger students. </p>
      <p> Overall, without Github, organizing code projects would be much more tedious for me, and for all other programmers working on software that will shape the future. It makes software development so much easier to manage and I can't imagine how today's
        programmers would manage without Github's features. This is why Github currently my favourite piece of technology. </p>
