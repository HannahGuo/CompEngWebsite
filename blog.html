      <br><b>Description</b>
      <p>On September 12th, 2017, Apple announced a new biometric authentication technology known as Face ID. Currently only implemented on the iPhone X. FaceID is a facial recognition software designed to replace Touch ID on the iPhone X’s full-screen display. It even works under conditions such as low light areas or if the user is wearing sunglasses. Face ID uses a combination of infrared emitter and sensor (what Apple calls TrueDepth) that plots about 30 000 points on your face. By using the reflection of these points, the software calculates the depth and angle of each point. From there, it creates and saves a map of the user’s face. When you wake up your phone from its sleep, it scans your face and compares it to this map. It will only unlock if your eyes are open and are directly looking at the phone, so you won’t unlock it accidentally. In addition, Face ID uses machine learning technology to adapt to your age and other physical changes such as a haircut. </p>

      <b>Benefits</b>
      <p>Face ID provides a fast way of unlocking a phone without using a physical sensor. This gives more room for the display, making full-screen phones like the iPhone X possible. It also allows for cool features, such as Animoji, to be available to the user. Face ID also supports third-party app development by providing APIs. Face ID can also be used as authentication for the various services like iTunes and Apple Pay. Using the user’s face as a password frees their hands to do other tasks, which increases productivity. </p>

      <b>Drawbacks</b>
      <p>The largest elephant in the room when it comes to Face ID is privacy. Although Face ID stores maps locally, a simple government policy change would require Apple to share this information with the government. This would allow them to use Face ID’s data to track people through security cameras and other surveillance. However, this isn’t very likely, at least not with the iPhone X, due to the way Apple created the technology.</p>

      <b>Conclusion</b>
      <p>When this technology was released, people also questioned how consistently it would perform, and how foolproof it was. Currently, there haven’t been any large breaks in Face IDs software, and Apple is continuing to develop it as well. Overall, with how accurate and practical Face ID and facial recognition technology are becoming, we may indeed be looking at the future of authentication.</p>

      <p>Github is the largest online code-sharing service. It allows programmers to collaborate together on projects, receive feedback from their users, and control versions of their code. It's also a place where developers can make their code available
        to the public (open-source) as a reference for others. Currently, Github reports having 27 million users and 77 million repositories (projects). Even organizations use this service, including <a href="https://github.com/nasa">NASA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nationalsecurityagency"> the NSA</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apple">Apple</a> use Github. </p>
      <p>I personally use Github almost daily for robotics to work together with my programming team. It makes coding in general much easier and also allows members of the team to share and work together. Also, this year, software for the robotics libraries
        are all hosted on Github, opposed to last year when all the information was in multiple PDFs. The clean interface and design of the Github documents are also much nicer and make it easier to read through. </p>
      <p>Github also has many other features for student developers, which gives them the tools they need to properly build their program. In fact, this website is hosted on Github Pages, which is a free hosting website that Github provides. It links directly
        to the Github repository as well, meaning no external hosting service is required.</p>
      <p>As our society becomes more technologically-driven, more and more programmers are creating software for our everyday lives. Github allows these great minds to work together to code the programs for our future. This can already be demonstrated during
        hackathons, where programmers work together to create a hack for a real-world problem. I've seen hacks created to help those with disabilities, to monitor nutrition and to educate younger students. </p>
      <p> Overall, without Github, organizing code projects would be much more tedious for me, and for all other programmers working on software that will shape the future. It makes software development so much easier to manage and I can't imagine how today's
        programmers would manage without Github's features. This is why Github currently my favourite piece of technology. </p>
