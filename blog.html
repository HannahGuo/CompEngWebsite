      <p>To disassemble the computer, we first unscrewed the side plate to expose the rest of the parts of the computer in the case. We also lay the computer down on its side to make the screws more accessible. </p>
      <img src="images/Setup.jpg" style="height:30%; width: 30%; float: right; display:block;">
      <p>From there, we worked quickly to remove all the parts in the steps that were given. We removed the hard drive and the CD-ROM (optical disk drive) from the case, followed by removing the network card, the sound card, the RAM chips from their slots on the motherboard. Then, we took out the power supply. Finally, once all the cables were unplugged from the motherboard, we unscrewed it and took it out too. We used a Phillips screwdriver to unscrew the screws that held the optical disk drive and motherboard to the case. </p>

      <p>I didn’t find taking the computer apart difficult at all, though reassembling took a bit longer because we had to plug all the wires back into their appropriate locations. I found the overall experience to be really interesting since this was the first time I’ve ever taken apart and reassembled a desktop. I always thought that building a computer was very difficult, but I was surprised at how easy it is to do. </p>

      <br><b>Description</b>
      <p>On September 12th, 2017, Apple announced a new biometric authentication technology known as Face ID. Currently only implemented on the iPhone X. FaceID is a facial recognition software designed to replace Touch ID on the iPhone X’s full-screen display. It even works under conditions such as low light areas or if the user is wearing sunglasses. Face ID uses a combination of infrared emitter and sensor (what Apple calls TrueDepth) that plots about 30 000 points on your face. By using the reflection of these points, the software calculates the depth and angle of each point. From there, it creates and saves a map of the user’s face. When you wake up your phone from its sleep, it scans your face and compares it to this map. It will only unlock if your eyes are open and are directly looking at the phone, so you won’t unlock it accidentally. In addition, Face ID uses machine learning technology to adapt to your age and other physical changes such as a haircut. </p>

      <b>Benefits</b>
      <p>Face ID provides a fast way of unlocking a phone without using a physical sensor. This gives more room for the display, making full-screen phones like the iPhone X possible. It also allows for cool features, such as Animoji, to be available to the user. Face ID also supports third-party app development by providing APIs. Face ID can also be used as authentication for the various services like iTunes and Apple Pay. Using the user’s face as a password frees their hands to do other tasks, which increases productivity. </p>

      <b>Drawbacks</b>
      <p>The largest elephant in the room when it comes to Face ID is privacy. Although Face ID stores maps locally, a simple government policy change would require Apple to share this information with the government. This would allow them to use Face ID’s data to track people through security cameras and other surveillance. However, this isn’t very likely, at least not with the iPhone X, due to the way Apple created the technology.</p>

      <b>Conclusion</b>
      <p>When this technology was released, people also questioned how consistently it would perform, and how foolproof it was. Currently, there haven’t been any large breaks in Face IDs software, and Apple is continuing to develop it as well. Overall, with how accurate and practical Face ID and facial recognition technology are becoming, we may indeed be looking at the future of authentication.</p>

      <span class="center"><b>Reasoning</b></span>
      <b>CPU - </b>
      With five thousand dollars to spend, I wanted to have a computer with the fastest performance. For my CPU, I chose the Intel - Core i7-8700K 3.7GHz 6-Core processor. Previously, I knew that the i7 Intel processors were the fastest (after the extremely
      expensive i9 processors, which I didn’t think I needed, and were double the price of the i7 processors). From there, I chose the fastest i7 processor. This CPU has 6 cores, 12 threads and runs at 3.7GHz base frequency speed.

      <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-cpus,3986.html">Additional Reference</a><br><br>

      <b>CPU Cooler - </b>
      When looking at coolers, I didn’t need the most powerful cooler because I would never be overclocking the CPU. In the end, I chose the Corsair - H100i v2 70.7 CFM Liquid CPU cooler because it was an affordable and effective cooler with positive
      ratings.<br><br>

      <b>Motherboard - </b>
      The Gigabyte - Z370 AORUS Gaming 5 (rev. 1.0) ATX LGA1151 motherboard is a top of the line motherboard. Although it’s expensive for a motherboard and is meant for gaming, I can afford it with this budget and it’s worth investing in for the performance it provides. This motherboard has a built-in Wifi and Bluetooth adapter, as well as a sound card, so I wouldn’t need to purchase these additional adapters. Other factors that made me choose this motherboard include the fact that it is durable and has addressable RGB LEDs.<br><br>

      <b>Memory - </b>
      I chose to invest in 32GB of RAM because I never want to have any problems with running out of RAM. The G.Skill - Trident Z RGB 32GB (4 x 8GB) DDR4-3000 Memory operates at 3000 clock cycles with Double Data Rate (DDR), meaning it will be fast enough for anything I use the computer for. The RAM also has full RGB support as an extra perk.<br><br>

      <b>Storage - </b>
      For storage, I chose to install two SAMSUNG 960 PRO M.2 512GB NVMe PCI-Express 3.0 x4 Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) MZ-V6P512BW. SSDs are faster compared to HDDs (hard disk drives) because SSDs store information on microchips and simply send a command to fetch information, whereas HDDs need to move a physical head to read and write data. I wanted 1TB of storage space because I believe that will be enough for school work and games. I can always use cloud storage if my SSDs run out of storage. I will also put my SSDs in RAID 0 to improve performance. RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) 0, also called disk striping, means that data will be spread across the two disks in the group. This makes accessing the data much faster.

      <b>Video Card - </b>
      I chose the MSI - GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11GB GAMING X for my video card. Considering I’m spending $5000 on this PC, I wanted to have an amazing video card. This video card provides a superior performance and a fast, smooth experience. If I ever decide to play VR, this video card is also able to handle that. As another perk, this video card has addressable RGB LEDs, which goes along with the rest of the PC.<br><br>

      <b>Case - </b>
      The case for my computer is a NZXT - S340 Elite (Black/Red) ATX Mid Tower. Overall, it’s a cleanly designed case that is strong and compact. The colours of the case, black and red, are simply a personal preference.<br><br>

      <b>Power Supply - </b>
      The EVGA - SuperNOVA P2 650W 80+ Platinum Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply provides more than enough power for my PC, which requires 489W. This power supply is 80+ Platinum, meaning that it is rated for at least 89% at 100% load, which is
      the best rating for a power supply. To contrast, the basic 80+ rating means the power supply is rated for at least 50% at 100% load.

      <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/how-does-psu-efficiency-affect-me-and-do-i-really-need-an-80-plus-gold-power-supply.129456">Additional Reference</a><br><br>

      <b>Case Fans - </b>
      Considering how much power my PC uses, I decided to invest in two case fans to keep it from overheating. The two Corsair - LL120 RGB LED 43.2 CFM 120mm fans will accomplish this perfectly, and even have 16 independent RGB LEDs that go along with the rest of the PC.<br><br>

      <b>Monitor - </b>
      I chose the Dell - S2417DG 23.8" 2560x1440 165Hz monitor because of the monitor’s fast refresh rate, high resolution and large size. This monitor will be perfect for anything I need to use the computer for.<br><br>

      <b>Keyboard - </b>
      The Logitech - G213 PRODIGY Wired Gaming Keyboard is a solid keyboard that can be used for both gaming and work. The design is clean and looks good, especially with its RGB lighting.<br><br>

      <b>Mouse - </b>
      The Logitech - G502 Proteus Spectrum Wired Optical Mouse is an ergonomic gaming mouse that comes with 11 programmable buttons, rubber grip, and a 1ms report rate. These features will not only be useful for when I’m gaming but also make working much
      smoother. Furthermore, this mouse has programmable RGB lights. <br><br>

      <b>Headphones - </b>
      With the remainder of my $5000 budget, I decided to buy a pair of Logitech headphones. The Logitech - G430 7.1 Channel Headset is noise-canceling and comes with a microphone. Both these features make using this PC for gaming or work calls very easy.<br><br>

      <b>Additional Notes - </b>
      Due to the high price of the full Windows 10 OS, I will be using Linux or Windows 10 evaluation, both of which are free. Any necessary Microsoft Office software can be downloaded for free through Education or a free alternative can be used.<br><br>

      <b>Overall - </b>
      Overall, this PC build was optimized to have the highest performance for the given budget. I will use this primarily for school work, programming and gaming, meaning all the parts will work perfectly. This computer is also built to last a very long time, since it was so expensive to build. Due to my high budget, I also decided to use parts that had RGB capabilities, just for the looks.<br><br>

      <span style="font-size: 8px">Thanks to the two grade twelves who guided me through building this PC, where everything is <i>the pinnacle of PC performance</i>.</span>

      <p>Github is the largest online code-sharing service. It allows programmers to collaborate together on projects, receive feedback from their users, and control versions of their code. It's also a place where developers can make their code available
        to the public (open-source) as a reference for others. Currently, Github reports having 27 million users and 77 million repositories (projects). Even organizations use this service, including <a href="https://github.com/nasa">NASA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nationalsecurityagency"> the NSA</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apple">Apple</a> use Github. </p>
      <p>I personally use Github almost daily for robotics to work together with my programming team. It makes coding in general much easier and also allows members of the team to share and work together. Also, this year, software for the robotics libraries
        are all hosted on Github, opposed to last year when all the information was in multiple PDFs. The clean interface and design of the Github documents are also much nicer and make it easier to read through. </p>
      <p>Github also has many other features for student developers, which gives them the tools they need to properly build their program. In fact, this website is hosted on Github Pages, which is a free hosting website that Github provides. It links directly
        to the Github repository as well, meaning no external hosting service is required.</p>
      <p>As our society becomes more technologically-driven, more and more programmers are creating software for our everyday lives. Github allows these great minds to work together to code the programs for our future. This can already be demonstrated during
        hackathons, where programmers work together to create a hack for a real-world problem. I've seen hacks created to help those with disabilities, to monitor nutrition and to educate younger students. </p>
      <p> Overall, without Github, organizing code projects would be much more tedious for me, and for all other programmers working on software that will shape the future. It makes software development so much easier to manage and I can't imagine how today's
        programmers would manage without Github's features. This is why Github currently my favourite piece of technology. </p>
