        <em>A diagram that shows how the Blockchain functions.</em>
      </span>
      <p>One of the emerging technologies at the moment is Blockchain. Created by the anonymous entity called Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, Blockchain is essentially a publically shared, constantly updated, distributed ledger for
        transactions.
      </p>
      <p>Blockchain is considered to be revolutionary, and there’s no doubt about its advantages. It isn’t stored in any single location or controlled by any single entity; instead, it’s hosted by millions of computers simultaneously. It’s also much harder
        for hackers to corrupt blockchain; there is no single point of failure for Blockchain. Another advantage of Blockchain is that it’s not centralized. There is no bank or government in control. This eliminates the trust issues that some users have with
        the bank or company of the bank they use. All records on the Blockchain are public to whoever wants them. There is no less incentive for hackers to corrupt the Blockchain, since there is no data to steal.
      </p>
      <p>To use Blockchain, all the users need to understand how currency and trade work, and have a basic understanding of how Blockchain works (clear descriptions can be found on various websites and videos). Some underlying concepts that Blockchain
        enthusiasts may want to research are cryptography, distributed computing, and mechanism design.
      </p>
      <p>Blockchain has the ability to change the future. Professionally, companies who implement Blockchain can stop being an intermediary for their transactions and instead allow it to be peer-to-peer. The decentralized idea that Blockchain could also be
        implemented into other uses, such as file-sharing. However, I feel Blockchain may take a while to be fully implemented in the world’s society. People are most comfortable with their current system and some trust their current transaction manager
        completely. The transition into any new technology does take some getting used to, and requires new skills. For example, although China’s WeChat payment system kicked off almost immediately, the rest of the world has been slower to adapt to it. It
        requires complete trust in the app’s creator, an understanding of how to protect personal information, and the ability to use a smartphone to replace older habits (for example, carrying around cash). Another example is the use of new smartphone
        verification systems, like FaceID. People needed to get used to the new technology and unlearn their habits of using passcodes and TouchID (fingerprint scanner).
      </p>
      <p>If Blockchain does become widely adopted, I personally feel like I will feel much comfortable with my purchases and transactions in the future. The transparency and immutability of Blockchain mean that there won’t be any tricks or changes that a
        regular system could possibly do.
      </p>

      </span><br><br>
      <p>With new hardware and software technologies constantly being developed, companies and individuals must alter their work styles in order to adapt. Although one would think that new technology is always better, there can be some hiccups along the way.
      </p>
      <img src="images/ios12.png" style="float:left; width: 23%; height:23%; margin: 20px;">
      <p>New technology is usually faster and more efficient to use compared to older technology. Furthermore, newer technology often includes new features that have been developed. Adapting to new technology also keeps the users up-to-date with society’s
        current technological trends. An example of a technology that was recently introduced was the iOS 12 update for Apple devices. Apple developers worked hard to optimize Apple’s new iOS operating system to ensure the smoothest user experience. It’s
        even compatible with older devices, dating back to 2013. The newest iOS update comes loaded with new features and software, such as grouped notifications. As augmented reality (AR) becomes more popular, they also released a Measure application to
        help users create AR experiences.
      </p>
      <img src="images/adapt.jpg" style="float:right; width: 35%; height:35%; margin: 20px;">
      <p>Despite the benefits, there are a few hiccups when it comes to adapting to new technology. First, since it is a new technology, there aren’t many people who are very knowledgeable about them. There are still some unknowns, and some may be
        reluctant to move on from what they found familiar. They may be unwilling to spend the time and effort required to learn something new. New technology is often more expensive too, due to the time that was needed to develop it. Finally, although all
        software is thoroughly tested before releasing it to the public, there is still the chance of errors when used on a larger scale. For example, laptops and new operating systems were a new territory for many seniors, and many are still reluctant to
        make the jump. Overall, companies and users need to balance the benefits and the expenses of adapting to new technology in order to decide which is better for them.
      </p>
      <p>One example of adapting to new technologies that I’ve experienced personally is through the change in the programming libraries in FRC. For the past few years, FRC’s Java programming library has included all features for speed controllers and
        basic robot features. However, this year, the functions for speed controllers were separated into another library. In addition, many function names were changed. It took our programmers a while to get used to the changes. The new libraries were still
        a work in progress for their developers, but provided many new unique features. This change in technology was confusing at first, but in the end was worth the change.

      <img src="images/FaceID.jpg" id="face" style="display:block; margin:auto;"/>
      <br>
      <p>On September 12th, 2017, Apple announced a new biometric authentication technology known as Face ID. Currently, only implemented on the iPhone X, FaceID is a facial recognition software designed to replace Touch ID on the iPhone X’s full-screen
        display. It works under various conditions such as low light areas or even if the user’s face is partially obscured. FaceID uses a combination of infrared emitter and sensor (what Apple calls TrueDepth) that plots about 30 000 points on your face.
        The software uses the reflection of these points to calculate the depth and angle of each point. From there, it creates and saves a map of the user’s face. When FaceID activates, it scans the user’s face and compares it to this saved map. If the map
        and the scanned face will only unlock if your eyes are open and are directly looking at the phone, so you won’t unlock it accidentally. In addition, Face ID uses machine learning technology to adapt to your age and other physical changes such as a
        haircut.
      </p>
      <p>Face ID provides a fast way of unlocking a phone without using a physical sensor. This gives more room for the display, making full-screen phones like the iPhone X possible. It also allows for cool features, such as Animoji, to be available to the
        user. Face ID also supports third-party app development by providing APIs. Face ID can also be used as authentication for the various services like iTunes and Apple Pay. Using the user’s face as a password frees their hands to do other tasks, which
        increases productivity.
      </p>
      <p>However, FaceID isn’t flawless, and many have concerns regarding the technology. The largest elephant in the room when it comes to Face ID is privacy. Although Face ID stores maps locally, a simple government policy change would require Apple to
        share this information with the government. This would allow them to use Face ID’s data to track people through security cameras and other surveillance. However, this isn’t very likely, at least not with the iPhone X, due to the way Apple created the
        technology.
      </p>
      <p>When this technology was released, people questioned how consistently it would perform, and how foolproof it was. Currently, there haven’t been any large breaks in Face IDs software, and Apple is continuing to develop it as well. Overall, with how
        accurate and practical Face ID and facial recognition technology are becoming, we may indeed be looking at the future of authentication.

      <p>Github is the largest online code-sharing service. It allows programmers to collaborate together on projects, receive feedback from their users, and control versions of their code. It's also a place where developers can make their code available
        to the public (open-source) as a reference for others. Currently, Github reports having 27 million users and 77 million repositories (projects). Even organizations use this service, including
        <a href="https://github.com/nasa ">NASA</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/nationalsecurityagency
      ">
          the NSA</a>
        and
        <a href="https://github.com/apple ">Apple</a>
        use Github.
      </p>
      <p>I personally use Github almost daily for robotics to work together with my programming team. It makes coding in general much easier and also allows members of the team to share and work together. Also, this year, software for the robotics
        libraries are all hosted on Github, opposed to last year when all the information was in multiple PDFs. The clean interface and design of the Github documents are also much nicer and make it easier to read through.
      </p>
      <p>Github also has many other features for student developers, which gives them the tools they need to properly build their program. In fact, this website is hosted on Github Pages, which is a free hosting website that Github provides. It links
        directly to the Github repository as well, meaning no external hosting service is required.</p>
      <p>As our society becomes more technologically-driven, more and more programmers are creating software for our everyday lives. Github allows these great minds to work together to code the programs for our future. This can already be demonstrated
        during hackathons, where programmers work together to create a hack for a real-world problem. I've seen hacks created to help those with disabilities, to monitor nutrition and to educate younger students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, without Github, organizing code projects would be much more tedious for me, and for all other programmers working on software that will shape the future. It makes software development so much easier to manage and I can't imagine how today's
        programmers would manage without Github's features. This is why Github currently my favourite piece of technology.
