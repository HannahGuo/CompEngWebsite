    <p>Github is the largest online code-sharing service. It allows programmers to collaborate together on projects, receive feedback from their users, and control versions of their code. It's also a place where developers can make their code available to the public (open-source) as a reference for others. Currently, Github reports having 27 million users and 77 million repositories (projects). Even organizations use this service, including <a href="https://github.com/nasa">NASA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nationalsecurityagency"> the NSA</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apple">Apple</a> use Github. </p>
    <p>I personally use Github almost daily for robotics to work together with my programming team. It makes coding in general much easier and also allows members of the team to share and work together. Also, this year, software for the robotics libraries are all hosted on Github, opposed to last year when all the information was in multiple PDFs. The clean interface and design of the Github documents are also much nicer and make it easier to read through. </p>
    <p>Github also has many other features for student developers, which gives them the tools they need to properly build their program. In fact, this website is hosted on Github Pages, which is a free hosting website that Github provides. It links directly to the Github repository as well, meaning no external hosting service is required.</p>
    <p>As our society becomes more technologically-driven, more and more programmers are creating software for our everyday lives. Github allows these great minds to work together to code the programs for our future. This can already be demonstrated during hackathons, where programmers work together to create a hack for a real-world problem. I've seen hacks created to help those with disabilities, to monitor nutrition and to educate younger students. </p>
    <p> Overall, without Github, organizing code projects would be much more tedious for me, and for all other programmers working on software that will shape the future. It makes software development so much easier to manage and I can't imagine how today's programmers would manage without Github's features. This is why Github currently my favourite piece of technology.  </p>
