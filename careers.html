    <em>1. Think about the places you have been during the last week—stores, the mall, the theater, home, school, etc.  Create a list of where you saw people making use of technology as part of their job and identify what it was each person was doing.  From this list, select one item.  Think about how much training it takes to learn to use the technology you saw being used on this job.  How often do you think the person needs to learn something new because of changing technology?</em>

    <p>Over the past week, I noticed people using technology at Georgian College, Tim Hortons, Gordon Graydon Memorial Secondary School and my home. </p>

    <ul>
      <li> <b>Georgian College</b>
        <ul>
          <li>FRC Field Tech Advisors
            <ul>
              <li>Help set up and manage the field management system</li>
              <li>Troubleshoot technical erros</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>FRC Field Referees
            <ul>
              <li>Use the field management system to enter in penalties</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Tim Hortons</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Cashiers
            <ul>
              <li>Use cash register to enter in orders and create receipts</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>School</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Teachers
            <ul>
              <li>Use projectors to show powerpoints</li>
              <li>Use computers to enter in marks</li>
              <li>Provide online resources for students</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Bus</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Bus Driver
            <ul>
              <li>Used a GPS to navigate to Barrie</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p> The FRC Field Tech Advisors (FTA) are responsible for making sure that the FRC field is running smoothly, and are consulted whenever there is a technical error. I think it takes at least a few hours of training to become an FTA, not including the
      hours needed to initially become an FTAA (Field Tech Assistant Advisor). They need to know how to repair each element and diagnose possible problems that could happen. The FTAs need to learn a bit of new technology every year because of the changing
      game elements, although some characteristics may be similar to previous years. The FMS (field management system) used at all events is the same and doesn’t change much throughout the years, so FTAs only need to learn it initially.</p>

    <em>2. Think about how the things you are learning in school that are helping to prepare you for jobs of the future. Discuss the knowledge you are gaining in school that is definitely going to make a difference when you begin to look for a job. What kinds
      of things can you identify that school is not providing for you at this time? What could you be doing in school to better prepare yourself for the jobs of the future?</em><br><br>

    <ul>
      <li> Computer Science and Computer Engineering
        <ul>
          <li>These two computer courses teach me to use technology in today’s work environment. Not only are they teaching me basic skills and getting me more comfortable with computers, but they are also giving me more experience for going into my desired
            work area. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Business
        <ul>
          <li>By taking this business course, I am learning new skills that are specifically tailored to help me in a business environment. Currently, I am learning soft skills, such as the importance of creativity, the feedback loop and the types of leaders.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> French
        <ul>
          <li>Learning French is definitely going to be an asset when I‘m looking for jobs because it means I’m bilingual. Due to Canada being a bilingual country, knowing a second language will allow me to help more people in whatever job I apply for.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I think what school doesn’t provide me with is the actual chance to apply all the knowledge that I’ve learned. For example, even if I know French, I have no way of proving my skill with the language. I think that giving a presentation outside school
      (for at least one subject) would be a better way to prepare for jobs of the future. This would allow students to show what they’ve learned at school in a real-world environment.

    <em>3. Many of the jobs that are the most interesting or challenging require you to attend a college or university before you can actually start working in your chosen field.  Being accepted into a program of higher education is not automatic.  You must meet specific requirements.  This means you must be careful to make the correct choices during your high school years.  Identify a college or university that is located near where you live.  What is necessary for you to qualify for admission to this school?  If you wanted to study computer science so you could become a computer programmer, what kinds of courses do you think you should take in high school?
</em><br><br>

    <p>In order to study Computer Science at the University of Toronto (Mississauga Campus), the following courses are needed <a href="http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/future-students/programs/computer-science-mathematics-statistics">(External Reference)</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Grade 12 English
        <ul>
          <li>Minimum Grade Range: Low to mid 70s</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Grade 12 Calculus (MCV4U)
        <ul>
          <li>Minimum Grade Range: Mid to high 80s</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Grade 12 Advanced Functions (MHF4U)</li>
      <li>4 other U/M courses
        <ul>
          <li>Reccomended: Mathematics of Data Management (MDM4U)</li>
          <li>Personal Reccomendation (I think it would be good to take): Grade 11/12 Computer Science</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The admission range for computer science at UTM is in the low 90s.</p>

    <em>4. Identify a career choice that interests you.  Create a list of courses you think might qualify you for admission for a program preparing you for this career.  What qualities do you identify in yourself that might suggest you could succeed in this field?
</em><br><br>

    <p>The career that interests me the most is that of a computer programmer. I think the best university program to attend for this job is Computer Science because it will give me the skills I need to successfully program. The following high school courses
      would be useful to take in preparation for Computer Science in university. Required courses are marked with a (*).</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Grade 12 English*</b>
        <ul>
          <li> English, in general, is a useful skill for proper communication skills. It's also required to graduate high school and is a requirement to be admitted into computer science, so it's not really an option.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Grade 12 Math Courses:
        <ul>
          <li> Due to computer programming requiring a lot of math and logic, it's best to take as many math courses as possible. These will help a lot when presented with math-related problems in university computer science.
            <ul> <b>
          <li>Calculus and Vectors *</li>
          <li> Advanced Functions *</li>
          <li> Data Management </li>
        </b></ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Grade 12 Computer Courses:
        <ul>
          <li> Computer science at a high school level should be understood in order to learn computer science at a university level. Grade 12 computer science will provide a valuable stepping stone in my learning. I believe that it's important to learn as
            much as possible about computers in order to become a computer programmer. This is why computer engineering is also included on this list, even if it's not a recommended course for computer science.
            <ul> <b>
          <li>Computer Science</li>
          <li>Computer Engineering</li>
        </b></ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I think that I would be successful in this field because I like learning and creating things. After attending multiple hackathons, I found that it’s really satisfying seeing a completed project. I also love programming, have always been strong in
      math and am keen in using computers. What I find neat about computer programming is how much you can create with a few words, expressions and some syntax on a screen. I think I'd succeed in this field because I’m patient, organized, and can easily
      solve logic puzzles. Furthermore, I pick up new concepts quickly so I can learn new programming languages and functions for my job as needed.</p>
