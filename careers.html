    <h1>Jobs with Tech</h1>
    <p>Over the past week, I noticed people using technology all around me. First, over the weekend, our school’s FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) team competed at a district event hosted at Georgian College. The technology of the field management system
      (FMS) was set up by the field tech advisors and the field referees used it to enter in penalty systems. The FMS was also behind calculating all the points during matches.</p>

    <p>However, it isn't just at robotics competitions where technology is used. I visited Tim Hortons and witnessed cashiers using registers to enter into orders and to print receipts for their customers. Furthermore, every day at school, teachers use all
      sorts of technology. They use projectors to show PowerPoint presentations to the class, teaching software such as Google Classroom and Edmodo to manage assignments, and a student profile program that calculates the students' grades and is used to
      mark their attendance. Bus drivers will also use their GPS to navigate routes until they have them memorized.</p>

    <p>Out of these jobs, the one that interested me the most was the FRC field tech advisor (FTA). They are responsible for making sure that the FRC field is running smoothly, and are consulted whenever there is a technical error. I think it takes at least
      a day of training to become an FTA, not including the hours needed to initially become an FTAA (Field Tech Assistant Advisor). They need to know how to repair each element and diagnose possible problems that could happen. The FTAs need to learn
      a bit of new technology every year because of the changing game elements, although some characteristics may be similar to previous years. The FMS (field management system) used at all events is the same and doesn’t change much throughout the years,
      so FTAs only need to learn it initially.</p><br>

    <h1>Education for Job Preparations</h1>
    <p>Personally, I have a very strong interest in technology and luckily, my school provides some skills that will help me prepare for jobs of the future. The computer science and computer engineering programs have gotten me more comfortable with computer
      terminology and concepts and have given me more experience with technology. My business class has taught me to learn skills that will help me excel on the business side of the tech world. Currently, I am learning soft skills, such as the importance
      of creativity, the feedback loop and the types of leaders. These will help me when I’m put in various working situations, like networking or collaborative projects. Finally, learning French has allowed me to be bilingual, which is an asset when
      I’m applying for jobs since I can help those who speak both English and French.</p>

    <p>However, I think the major flaws that in school is that it doesn’t provide is real-world application and students don’t really get the chance to prove that they have learned something. In computer engineering, for example, manually converting computer
      numeral systems seem useless when we have calculators. I would instead want to spend more time on learning which systems are used when, and why. Computer science is better since we do have a summative, and French just needs practice. I would have
      liked a business trip to a real workplace environment to see the skills we learned in action.</p>

    <p>Since I want to pursue the career of a computer programmer, one of the possible nearby university programs I can attend is Computer Science at the University of Toronto, Mississauga. To qualify for admission, I need a high school diploma, a low to
      mid 80s grade range, 4U English, Calculus, Advanced Functions, and three additional university-level grade 12 courses. It’s also recommended to take Data Management. Evidently, I would recommend following all these requirements and recommendations,
      as well as taking all Computer Science courses in high school as preparation for university.</p><br>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>To prepare myself to become a computer programmer, I would take all the courses mentioned above since they’re required for the program that will help me achieve my career goal. I think that I would be successful in this field because I like learning
      and creating things. After attending multiple hackathons, I have found that it’s really satisfying seeing a completed project. I also love programming, have always been strong in math and I am keen in using computers.</p>
