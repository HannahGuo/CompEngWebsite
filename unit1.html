      </span>
      <p>To disassemble the computer, we first unscrewed the side plate to expose the rest of the parts of the computer in the case. We also lay the computer down on its side to make the screws more accessible. From there, we worked quickly to remove all
        the parts in the steps that were given. We removed the hard drive and the CD-ROM (optical disk drive) from the case, followed by removing the network card, the sound card, the RAM chips from their slots on the motherboard. Then, we took out the power
        supply. Finally, once all the cables were unplugged from the motherboard, we unscrewed it and took it out too. We used a Phillips screwdriver to unscrew the screws that held the optical disk drive and motherboard to the case.</p>
      <img src="images/Setup.jpg" style="height:30%; width: 30%; float: right; display:block; margin:10px;">
      <p>I didn’t find taking the computer apart difficult at all, though reassembling took a bit longer because we had to plug all the wires back into their appropriate locations. We were also very careful in assembling parts in order not to damage them.
        I found the overall experience to be really interesting since this was the first time I’ve ever taken apart and reassembled a desktop. I always thought that building a computer was intimidating since there were so many parts, wires and specifications
        to keep track of. However, I was surprised at how easy it is to do once you have the knowledge needed.

              information on microchips and simply send a command to fetch information, whereas HDDs need to move a physical head to read and write data. I wanted 1TB of storage space because I believe that will be enough for school work and games. I can always
              use cloud storage if my SSDs run out of storage. I will also put my SSDs in RAID 0 to improve performance. RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) 0, also called disk striping, means that data will be spread across the two disks in the group.
              This makes accessing the data much faster.

The Logitech - G430 7.1 Channel Headset is noise-canceling and comes with a microphone. Both these features make using this PC for gaming or work calls very easy.</td>

        Due to the high price of the full Windows 10 OS, I will be using Linux or Windows 10 evaluation, both of which are free. Any necessary Microsoft Office software can be downloaded for free through Education or a free alternative can be used. Overall,
        this PC build was optimized to have the highest performance for the given budget. I will use this primarily for school work, programming and gaming, meaning all the parts will work perfectly. This computer is also built to last a very long time,
        since it was so expensive to build. Due to my high budget, I also decided to use parts that had RGB capabilities, just for the looks.<br>
        <span style="font-size: 8px; color:white">Thanks to the two grade twelves who guided me through building this PC, where everything is the pinnacle of PC performance.</span>
