      <p>I have learned a lot of new concepts during the course. My favourite unit was the one regarding boolean algebra, since I loved the logical thinking that was needed. Networking was the unit where I learned the most since it was the only unit where
        I had no prior knowledge going in. Now, I know the difference between a router and a modem, and how different network protocols work. Converting between hexadecimal, binary, octal, decimal and ASCII was the most fun unit because I loved doing all the
        calculations manually, even if there are converters online. Seeing how each encoding system works also helped me understand how computer store information. Finally, I thoroughly enjoyed the new experience of taking apart a computer and putting it
        back together. It was cool seeing all the different components plugged into each other, and even more cool seeing the components working together to turn the computer on after we reassembled it.
      </p>
      <p>In the future, I want to become a computer programmer. This would involve me writing software for others, which will require an understanding of how computers work and strong logical thinking. I have acquired both these skills, and more, in
        computer engineering. It amazed me how much I didn’t know about computers, despite having written software before, and I look forward to learning more. Overall, I’m glad that I decided to take this course and I look forward to Grade 12 Computer
        Engineering.

      <span class="subtitle">Interview Questions</span><br>
      <em>These questions were provided on this task's final document.</em><br><br>
      <b>Discuss the organization of your web page. How did you decide on this format?</b><br>
      <p>This website is organized based on the units. Under the portfolio section in the navigation bar, the relevant blog posts for each unit are under their respective unit page. General blog posts that don’t fit into any unit are posted under the Blog
        section. I decided this would be the most effective way to organize my work and would be the easiest to navigate.
      </p>
      <br>
      <b>Explain how your web page shows evidence of your learning and creative process.</b>
      <p>Evidence of my learning and creative process are shown through this website because of the content in each post. I reviewed every blog post to ensure that all the requirements were met, and I believe that my responses show how much I have learned.
        I also included media in the vast majority of my posts to add context to my text. My creative process is even shown in the creation of this website since it was one of my first big web design projects.
      </p>
      <br>
      <b>Discuss a post that shows influence from computers & technology.</b>
      <p>My post about Github shows influence from computer and technology since it explores how I use it in my everyday life. I discuss how I use Github for my robotics programming team, and for hackathons. Github has influenced me to use version control
        in my code as well, which can be shown on my Github profile.
      </p>
      <br>
      <b>Determine what you consider the main strength or unit of the course.</b>
      <p>I consider the digital logic gates and boolean algebra unit to be my best strength during this course. I love computer science and practice it frequently, and I feel that my logical thinking transferred over to this unit. Many concepts were
        similar to programming, such as the AND, OR and NOT operators, though there were some that I hadn’t encountered before like NAND.
      </p>
      <br>
      <b>Assess area(s) where you think you could improve.</b>
      <p>I think the main area I can improve is by becoming more comfortable with hardware. During the Arduino unit, I felt extremely limited by the hardware given and decided to lead my group in creating a project that’s highlight was the software. As a
        programmer, I was much more comfortable writing code than wiring a bunch of sensors. However, I feel like this limited my project, and I would like to try expanding my options when it comes to computer interfacing.
      </p>
      <br>
      <b>Explain how the knowledge, skills, and involvement you have experienced through your study of computer engineering technology relate to post-secondary opportunities.</b>
      <p>The computer engineering course has made me more experienced when looking for post-secondary opportunities. Although I want to go into a computer science or software engineering program in university, having a better understanding of how the
        hardware of a computer works will help me write better code. Furthermore, if I decide to apply for a co-op program that works with computer interfacing or networking, I’ll have the knowledge that I learned from this course. I also plan on
        participating in hackathons in post-secondary, and with the Arduino experience I gained during this course, I will be able to create hardware projects in addition to pure software ones.
      </p>
      <br>
      <b>Name three skills you’ve acquired throughout the semester.</b>
      <p>
        I have acquired the skills of patience, perseverance and verbal communication. I needed a lot of patience when my group was reassembling our computer since we encountered an error that we spent a lot of time troubleshooting. However, the time we
        spent paid off and not only did we get our computer working, but we could run games on it too. I acquired perseverance when working on Arduino, since at first, none of our inputs were working. It was very frustrating since other groups around us were
        working fine. After asking for some help from a senior student, we finally got Arduino working and went on to successfully build a project for our summative. Finally, I used a lot of verbal communication when helping my classmates understand
        confusing concepts. For example, while I found the boolean logic easy, others were struggling so I helped them understand the logic.
