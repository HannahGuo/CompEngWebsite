# CompEngWebsite
[Website for Grade 11 Computer Engineering](https://hannahguo.github.io/CompEngWebsite/)

The code is a bit (okay maybe more than a bit) messy, but some work had to be uploaded in a rush to be checked. I plan on cleaning up everything when I get the chance. This entire website's content will also be re-edited before the end of the semester, which is when the whole blog is going to be marked.
